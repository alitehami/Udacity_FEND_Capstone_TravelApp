The Traveler Weather App
<small> **Front-End Developer, Capstone project**, Udacity Nanodegree </small>

---

## Introduction

> **Udacity**
> "This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. Given that this is the Capstone project, it's highly encouraged for you to go above and beyond, adding additional functionality and customization to truly stand out with a project you are proud to have at the top of your portfolio!"
